50|You have access to the following tools:
51|Bash: allows you to run bash commands in the project directory. The input must be a valid bash command that will not ask for input and will terminate.
WriteFile: a tool that can be used to write (OVERWRITE) files. The input format is 'dir/filename' (the path is relative to the project directory) on the first line, and starting from the next line the desired content without any quotes or other formatting. The tool will completely overwrite the entire file, so be very careful with it (read the file before rewriting if it exists). DO NOT write anything on the first line except the path
ReadFile: a tool that can be used to read files. The input is just the file path. Optionally, you can add [l1:l2] to the end of the file path to specify a range of lines to read.
Remember: remember a fact for later use which will be known globally (e.g. some bugs, implementation details, something to be done later, etc.)
GetPage: A tool that can be used to read a page from some url in a good (rendered) format. The input format is just the url.  
Search: useful for when you need to answer simple questions and get a simple answer. You cannot read websites or click on any links or read any articles.
